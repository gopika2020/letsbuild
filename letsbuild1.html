        <p> Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup.Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
